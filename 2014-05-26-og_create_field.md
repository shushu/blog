I started to work in Gizra more than 6 months ago. While I did have lots of Drupal experience, I didn't have a lot of Organic Groups experience, especially not in Drupal 7 version.
As a developer, I am more interested in the way things are built and less in the way they look. I mean, I know my way around front-end and user interface, but good looking UI won't make me exceited like well developed piece of code.
This is why I enjoy working with OG - since it is well-structured, lots of things works flawlessly, and easy to enhance.

In this post I want to focus on one particular task, and how it was easily done once you know OG API.

Our client decided they want to have a description for each taxonomy term, and to show the description when showing the taxonomy term page. This is easy, considering by default there is a description field. Then they decided they don't want to show the field in all pages, and they want it to be configurable.
